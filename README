Archaeopteryx is a MIDI system for Ruby based on code from Topher Cyll's book "Practical Ruby
Projects."

Archaeopteryx successfully generates original drum and bass rhythms, synchs original rhythms to
MP3 playback, and crossfades between existing MP3 tracks.

Archaeopteryx is a Ruby front-end to prosumer music software such as Propellerhead Reason and
Ableton Live. You need a MIDI consumer to get anything useful out of it.
